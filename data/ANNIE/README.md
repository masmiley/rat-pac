ANNIE Detector Mockup
=====================
This is a basic example of the ANNIE detector, as interpreted from

    http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6411, Figure 4

This example was neither created nor reviewed by ANNIE collaborators.

Currently the water volume is instrumented by PMTs but the muon veto and
and Muon Range Detector are just shapes. These should be configured either
as sensitive detectors or modeled better and instrumented with PMTs, depending
on how detailed a simulation is needed.

Also, all the PMTs are 8". The bottom ones should be 10".
